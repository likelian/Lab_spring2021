# Lab_spring2021

2/7 meeting
---------------
**Last weeek (1/31 - 2/7):**
1. madmom library, audio => chroma => chord symbol & timestamp => root note & timestamp =...90%...> midi for bass
2. install Open-Unmix 0% done (skip it)

**meeting discussion:**
- What kind of audio as input? with or without drums?
- Genre specific or not? (Metal?)
- If this is user-driven using summed track, is it really easy to use except python environment? (genre identification)
- Is source seperation necessary?
- Tempo?


**Next Week (2/8 - 2/14):**
1. checkout Studio One
2. finish midi for bass
3. Come up with an alternative plan if one or current libraries doesn’t work (individual tracks?)
4. Look at many genres, find music textbook
5. Start with onset/drum/tempo...

--------------
**Last weeek (2/8 - 2/14):**
1. Studio One has very good chord detection and basic bass line generation. It doesn’t consider rhythmic information unless the user write it out.
